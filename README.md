## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to develop a Python-based data analytics application and implement a complete CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline will automate the processes of building, testing, deploying, and monitoring the application using tools like Docker, Minikube, Jenkins, and others.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Version Control**: GitHub  
- **Containerization**: Docker  
- **Orchestration**: Minikube (Kubernetes)  
- **CI/CD Tool**: Jenkins  
- **Build Tool**: Maven (optional, for integration with Jenkins)  
- **Testing Tool**: Pytest and Selenium (optional for web interfaces)  
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible or Chef  
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch  

---

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming.  
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub for version control.  
- Knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and cloud services.  

---

## Steps to Complete the Assignment

### 1. Project Setup on GitHub
- Create a GitHub repository for the project.  
- Set up a directory structure that includes folders for data, source code, tests, Kubernetes manifests, and documentation.  
- Include a sample dataset in the `data` folder for analytics.

### 2. Develop the Application
- Build a Python application to process data analytics, structured with reusable modules.  
- Set up a virtual environment for dependency management.  
- Implement core functionality, ensuring all components are testable.

### 3. Containerization with Docker
- Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application.  
- Use a lightweight Python image, include the necessary dependencies, and expose the application for local or orchestrated deployment.

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
- Set up Jenkins to automate the application lifecycle:
  - Build the project and install dependencies.  
  - Run tests to validate functionality.  
  - Build a Docker image of the application.  
  - Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.  

### 5. Testing with Pytest and Selenium
- Write unit tests using Pytest for data analytics components.  
- Optionally, create Selenium tests if the application includes a web interface.

### 6. Deployment with Minikube
- Deploy the application to a local Kubernetes cluster.  
- Write deployment and service manifests to scale the application and expose it via NodePort.

### 7. Configuration Management with Ansible or Chef
- Use Ansible or Chef to automate server provisioning and application deployment.  
- Configure tasks like installing Docker, setting up Kubernetes, and deploying application manifests.

### 8. Monitoring with AWS CloudWatch (Bonus)
- Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor application performance.  
- Configure dashboards to visualize CPU and memory usage and track application logs.

## Deliverables
1. **GitHub Repository**:  
   Public repository with the complete project code, Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, Kubernetes manifests, and configuration scripts.  
2. **Documentation**:  
   A README file with setup instructions, details about the CI/CD pipeline, and steps to deploy and run the application.  
3. **Presentation or Report**:  
   A summary of the project, including challenges faced, solutions implemented, and key takeaways.

---

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Code Quality**: Clean, modular, and well-documented code.  
- **Completeness**: All components of the CI/CD pipeline are functional.  
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions and detailed project documentation.  
- **Presentation**: Ability to articulate the project workflow and outcomes effectively.

---

## How to Run the Application
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.  
2. Build the Docker image and run the container.  
3. Access the application locally or deploy it using Minikube.  
4. Verify the application functionality by running tests.
